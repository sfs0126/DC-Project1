# DC-Project1
Please read: 
    Chapters 12 and 13 in "Spark : The Definitive Guide" by Chambers and Zaharia
    Chapter 4 (Spark) from  "Hadoop with Python"

The data that you are working with for this project is not huge. The goal is to ease you into larger data sets. (I expect project 2 will involve larger amounts of data)

However, despite the size of the data, I would like you to do some of the data processing with Spark. In particular, your group should focus on analysis techniques that would work even if I came back next week and gave you 20-times as much data. 

Also, when working with large data sets, you should try to get in the habit of not copying data any more than necessary. I am creating a working folder for each of the teams, if you need to transform the data, you can put transformed data into the working folder. However, please coordinate with your teammates so that you don't need to keep any more copies of the data around than is absolutely required. Also, don't hesitate to coordinate with other teams to avoid keeping around two copies of the same reformatted data. 

Your group will have just over a month to work on this project. You are expected to deliver a presentation that addresses some of the questions below. Your goal is to tell a convincing story about the data. The presentation is the most important deliverable. I also ask you to turn in all code that you write as part of the project, but this is supporting material and your focus should be on creating a compelling presentation. 



The data includes (relatively) modern internet writing from a variety of blogs and also from the Hacker News site. 

I am generally interested in how this writing differs from more traditional writing in the English language. Here are some initial questions to guide your thinking, but I encourage you to be creative and to not feel limited by these questions. That is, I am really interested in how modern Internet writing is different (or perhaps not that different) from more traditional writing, any observations/analysis that you make on this topic are welcome. 

Word Choice:  What can you say about word choice in modern Internet writing? What kinds of words are more less prevalent in the more modern data sets? 
       One particular area that you might dig deeper into are adjectives â€¦ Has adjective use changed in any meaningful way in this Internet writing? (Similar questions could be asked about adverbs?)
       Another area that you might dig deeper into is pronoun use. Are pronouns used more/less often as compared to referencing the noun by name. 

Writing Structure: What can you say about differences in writing structure? For example, are sentences longer or shorter? Is the use of punctuation different in any significant way?  Are certain types of sentences more common? 

Common Phrases:  This is related to word choice, but are there any short phrases that were favored by the traditional writers that don't see much use on the modern internet? Or vice versa?

Other: Is there anything else that you can infer about the way that people write on the Internet from these data sets?
